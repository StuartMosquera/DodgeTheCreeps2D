# Dodge the Creeps 2D

This is my first 2D game, which I created by following the step-by-step tutorial from the [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/).

In this simple game, the player must _dodge_ enemies for as long as possible.

- **Engine:** Godot .NET
- **Renderer:** Compatibility
